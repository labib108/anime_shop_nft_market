ERC721URIStorage: The standard NFT logic + the ability to store a unique URL (IPFS link) for every single token individually.

ERC721Royalty: Implements EIP-2981. This is the standard that tells marketplaces (OpenSea, Blur) "Pay this address X% when this item is sold."

State Variables: uint256 private _nextTokenId;
A counter variable stored on the blockchain

Ownable: Adds a security layer. It creates an owner variable and an onlyOwner modifier, so only you can run administrative functions.

ERC721("name", "symbol"): Calls the parent constructor to name your collection with the ticker symbol.

_safeMint: The core logic. It writes to the blockchain: "Address to now owns Token ID 0". "Safe" means it checks if the receiver is a valid wallet/contract.

Diamond Inheritance problem: Diamond Problem is a classic ambiguity issue when Multiple Inheritance.class inherits from two classes that both inherit from the same common superclass.
It uses C3 Linearization to resolve diamond problem
 ERC721 - base class
 ERC721URIStorage, ERC721Royalty - derived class
 tokenURI - inherit drived class properties, so confused which one need to execute.
 need override. l3 linearization like python MRO - Method Resolution Order 
 super.tokenURI,super.supportsInterface

 interface IERC2981: Defines the EIP-2981 Royalty Interface. This tells the Marketplace how to read the required royalty amount and receiver address from the NFT contract.

Event: store arguments in the transaction log,Events are stored in the transaction's log section
 indexed: enables efficient search and filtering

 When a parameter in an event is marked indexed, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) stores that parameter in a special structure within the log called "topics" instead of the log's "data" section.

 Topics (Indexed): These are easily searchable headers.
external: function visibility specifier,read directly from the calldata

IERC721:Interface ERC-721
